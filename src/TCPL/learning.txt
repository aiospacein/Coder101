To solve question:
1) read the statement
2) devide into methoods or function ignore the details
    Task #	Sub-task
1	Read a full line from input
2	Remove trailing blanks/tabs from that line
3	If resulting line is empty → skip printing
4	Print cleaned line

Now you have the structure of the program mentally.
Think about corner cases
🌟 General Step-by-Step Approach

Whenever you read a problem:

1️⃣ Understand EXACTLY what the problem is asking

Do not think about code immediately.

Ask yourself:

What is the input?

What is the expected output?

What transformation is needed?

📌 Example (Exercise 1-18):

Remove trailing blanks/tabs from each line and delete empty lines.

So:

Input = multiple lines with possibly extra spaces/tabs

Output = cleaned lines

2️⃣ Identify the core tasks

Break the problem into small logical subtasks.

For Exercise 1-18:

Task #	Sub-task
1	Read a full line from input
2	Remove trailing blanks/tabs from that line
3	If resulting line is empty → skip printing
4	Print cleaned line

Now you have the structure of the program mentally.

3️⃣ Think about corner cases

Many candidates fail because they ignore these.

Examples:

A line that contains only spaces

A line that has no trailing spaces

A very long line that exceeds buffer

A line not ending with newline before EOF

Considering these avoids bugs later.

4️⃣ Plan functions / flow

Decide whether to use multiple functions or single function.

Reasonable split:

getline_custom() → input handling

remove_trailing() → whitespace cleanup

This separation simplifies logic.

5️⃣ THEN think about coding

🧠 Mental template for solving ANY problem

Whenever you see a new problem, fill this:

Step	Questions to ask yourself
Problem	What exactly is asked?
Input	What data do I get?
Output	What data should I produce?
Rules	What constraints?
Sub-tasks	What steps to reach output?
Edge Cases	What special cases can break code?

Write this mentally or on paper — it makes solution obvious.

⭐ Bonus: Apply to Exercise 1-16 (Longest line)

What is problem?

Read input lines

Print the longest one and its length

Subtasks:

Read line

Measure length of the line

Compare with max length

Store the longest

Print result

Edge cases:

Multiple longest lines same length

Very long line > buffer

Input ends without newline

→ Now the program practically writes itself.

🔑 Final takeaway

Do NOT try to “think in code”, think in logic and tasks.
Code is only the final translation.
